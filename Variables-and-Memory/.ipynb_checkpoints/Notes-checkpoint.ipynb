New memory on the stack is allocated when the path of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left.

In general, managing memory on the heap is more (computationally) expensive for the operating system, which makes it slower than stack memory. Contrary to the stack, the heap is not managed automatically by the system, but by the programmer.

For a program that runs, computes something, and quits immediately, memory leaks are usually not a big concern. Memory leaks are mostly problematic for programs that run for a long time and/or use large data structures. In such a case, memory leaks can gradually fill the heap until allocation requests can no longer be properly met and the program stops responding or crashes completely. We will look at an example further down in this section.\n",
