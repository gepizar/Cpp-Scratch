New memory on the stack is allocated when the path of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left.

In general, managing memory on the heap is more (computationally) expensive for the operating system, which makes it slower than stack memory. Contrary to the stack, the heap is not managed automatically by the system, but by the programmer.

For a program that runs, computes something, and quits immediately, memory leaks are usually not a big concern. Memory leaks are mostly problematic for programs that run for a long time and/or use large data structures. In such a case, memory leaks can gradually fill the heap until allocation requests can no longer be properly met and the program stops responding or crashes completely. We will look at an example further down in this section.\n",

    "In the previous chapters, we have seen that memory management on the heap using malloc/free or new/delete is extremely powerful, as they allow for a fine-grained control over the precious memory resource. However, the correct use of these concepts requires some degree of skill and experience (and concentration) from the programmer. If they are not handled correctly, bugs will quickly be introduced into the code. A major source of error is that the details around memory management with new/delete are completely left to the programer. In the remainder of this lesson, the pair malloc/free will be omitted for reasons of brevity. However, many of the aspects that hold for new/delete will also apply to malloc/free.\n",

If the programer forgets to call delete (which can happen very quickly) or if it is done at an \"inappropriate\" position, memory leaks will occur which might clog up a large portion of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correct operator pairing** : C++ offers a variety of new/delete operators, especially when dealing with arrays on the heap. A dynamically allocated array initialized with new[] may only be deleted with the operator delete[]. If the wrong operator is used, program behavior will be undefined - which is to be avoided at all cost in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory ownership** : If a third-party function returns a pointer to a data structure, the only way of knowing who will be responsible for resource deallocation is by looking into either the code or the documentation. If both are not available (as is often the case), there is no way to infer the ownership from the return type. As an example, in the final project of this course, we will use the graphical library wxWidgets to create the user interface of a chatbot application. In wxWidgets, the programmer can create child windows and control elements on the heap using new, but the framework will take care of deletion altogether. If for some reason the programmer does not know this, he or she might call delete and thus interfere with the inner workings of the wxWidgets library.\n",

As soon as a smart pointer goes out of scope, its destructor is called and the block of memory to which the internal raw pointer refers is properly deallocated. This technique of wrapping a management class around a resource has been conceived by Bjarne Stroustroup and is called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).

In the case of RAII this is the management class around the protected resource. **The overall goal is to have allocation and deallocation (e.g. with new and delete) disappear from the surface level of the code you write**.\n",

Then, the result of a division is printed to the console. At the end of the loop, delete is called to properly deallocate the heap memory to which en is pointing. Even though this code is working as it is supposed to, it is very easy to forget to call delete at the end. Let us therefore use the principles of RAII to create a management class that calls delete automatically:\n",

When the destructor of a MyInt object is called, the resource is deleted from memory - which makes MyInt an RAII memory management class. Also, the * operator is overloaded which enables us to dereference MyInt objects in the same manner as with raw pointers. Let us therefore slightly alter our code example from above to see how we can properly use this new construct:\n",

    "\n",
    "After creating an object of class MyInt on the stack, which, internally, created an integer on the heap, we can use the dereference operator in the same manner as before to retrieve the value to which the internal raw pointer is pointing. Because the MyInt object en lives on the stack, it is automatically deallocated after each loop cycle - which automatically calls the destructor to release the heap memory. The following console output verifies this:\n",

In the scope of this course, we will briefly discuss three of them:  \n",

To reduce the risk of undefined behavior, `malloc` and `free` should thus be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R. 11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly**\n",
    "Programmers have to make sure that every call of `new` is paired with the appropriate `delete` at the correct position so that no memory leak or invalid memory access occur. The emphasis here lies in the word \"explicitly\" as opposed to implicitly, such as with smart pointers or containers in the standard template library. \n",

    "Both pointer types express ownership and responsibilities (R. 20). A `unique_ptr` is an exclusive owner of the managed resource; therefore, it cannot be copied, only moved. In contrast, a `shared_ptr` shares the managed resource with others. As described above, this mechanism works by incrementing and decrementing a common reference counter. The resulting administration overhead makes `shared_ptr` more expensive than `unique_ptr`. For this reason `unique_ptr` should always be the first choice (R. 21). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **R. 22 : Use make_shared() to make shared_ptr**\n",

    "The increased management overhead compared to raw pointers becomes in particular true if a `shared_ptr` is used. Creating a `shared_ptr` requires (1) the allocation of the resource using new and (2) the allocation and management of the reference counter. Using the factory function `make_shared` is a one-step operation with lower overhead and should thus always be preferred. (R.22). This also holds for `unique_ptr` (R.23), although the performance gain in this case is minimal (if existent at all). \n",

    "But there is an additional reason for using the `make_...` factory functions: Creating a smart pointer in a single step removes the risk of a memory leak. Imagine a scenario where an exception happens in the constructor of the resource. In such a case, the object would not be handled properly and its destructor would never be called - even if the managing object goes out of scope. Therefore, `make_shared` and `make_unique` should always be preferred.  Note that `make_unique` is only available with compilers that support at least the C++14 standard.\n",

A function should take smart pointers as parameter only if it examines or manipulates the smart pointer itself. As we have seen, smart pointers are classes that provide several features such as counting the references of a `shared_ptr` or increasing them by making a copy. Also, data can be moved from one `unique_ptr` to another and thus transferring the ownership. A particular function should accept smart pointers only if it expects to do something of this sort. If a function just needs to operate on the underlying object without the need of using any smart pointer property, it should accept the objects via raw pointers or references instead. \n",

In `f`, the address of the copied / moved unique pointer `ptr`  is printed and the function `printVal()` is called on it.
