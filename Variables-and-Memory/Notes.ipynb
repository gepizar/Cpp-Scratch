    "* The **stack** is a contiguous memory block with a fixed maximum size. If a program exceeds this size, it will crash. The stack is used for storing automatically allocated variables such as local variables or function parameters. If there are multiple threads in a program, then each thread has its own stack memory. New memory on the stack is allocated when the path of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left. It is important to know that the stack is managed \"automatically\" by the compiler, which means we do not have to concern ourselves with allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **heap** (also called \"free store\" in C++) is where data with dynamic storage lives. It is shared among multiple threads in a program, which means that memory management for the heap needs to take concurrency into account. This makes memory allocations in the heap more complicated than stack allocations. In general, managing memory on the heap is more (computationally) expensive for the operating system, which makes it slower than stack memory. Contrary to the stack, the heap is not managed automatically by the system, but by the programmer. If memory is allocated on the heap, it is the programmer’s responsibility to free it again when it is no longer needed. If the programmer manages the heap poorly or not at all, there will be trouble.\n",

    "* The **Data segment** serves the same purpose as the BSS segment with the major difference being that variables in the Data segment have been initialized with a value other than zero. Memory for variables in the Data segment (and in BSS) is allocated once when a program is run and persists throughout its lifetime.\n"

This is the major difference to automatic and static allocation, where the size of the variable must be known at compile time.
