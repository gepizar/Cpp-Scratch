A program that forgets to clear a memory block is said to have a memory leak - this may be a serious problem or not, depending on the circumstances and on the nature of the program. For a program that runs, computes something, and quits immediately, memory leaks are usually not a big concern. Memory leaks are mostly problematic for programs that run for a long time and/or use large data structures. In such a case, memory leaks can gradually fill the heap until allocation requests can no longer be properly met and the program stops responding or crashes completely. We will look at an example further down in this section.\n",

    "2. Buffer Overruns Buffer overruns occur when memory outside the allocated limits is overwritten and thus corrupted. One of the resulting problems is that this effect may not become immediately visible. When a problem finally does occur, cause and effect are often hard to discern. It is also sometimes possible to inject malicious code into programs in this way, but this shall not be discussed here. \n",
